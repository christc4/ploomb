## What is plumbing?

Plumbing is a mechanism for passing messages between applications. It has a customizable set of rules (see `plumb(6)`) to process incoming messages and dispatch them to target applications.

The `plumber(4)` is the file server that performs the message processing and dispatch.

It is up to each application how it wishes to use this mechanism, but in the user-interface domain, the mechanism often allows the user to point to a file-name or URL and have the associated resource processed by an appropriate application.
